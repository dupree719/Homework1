mkdir = make directory/creates a new directory
mv = move/rename an existing directory
ls = list items/contents
touch = create a new file
cat = reads and prints out file contents
cd . . = moves back a directory
cd = jumps to home directory
vi "filename.extension" = creates a virtual environment
cp "file.extension" = copies file
rm "file" = deletes file
pwd = prints working directories
i = insert into virtual environment
:wq = Exits virtual environment
clear = moves command up and clears terminal
git init = initiates repository
git commit = commits to GitHub
git status = reports current status of a file
cd "directory name" = jumps to specific directory
